# Python Projects & Learning Archive

This repository is a personal collection of Python scripts, projects, and experiments.  
As I learn Python and explore different concepts, I’ll keep updating this repo with every `.py` file I create — from simple practice to real-world applications.

## What's Inside

- **Practice Files** – Small scripts from tutorials and exercises.
- **Projects** – Custom tools and mini-projects I’ve built along the way.
- **Experiments** – Testing libraries, concepts, or ideas.
- **Future Goals** – Data Science, Automation, and Machine Learning.

## Why This Repo?

- To track my progress as I learn Python.
- To organize all my code in one place.
- To share useful scripts that others might benefit from.
