    "I canâ€™t even.",

    "Iâ€™ve heard of it, but Iâ€™m not sure.",
    "Not my problem!",
    "Iâ€™m not sure. Try asking someone else.",
    "Is this really necessary?",
    "Iâ€™m only human... oh wait, Iâ€™m not.",
    "Why do you keep asking? Are you trying to annoy me?",
    "Nope. Thatâ€™s all Iâ€™ve got.",
    "This isnâ€™t the answer youâ€™re looking for, is it?",
    "Iâ€™m not sure, but I guess weâ€™ll never know.",
    "Well, thatâ€™s a weird question.",
    "I mean, sure, but why though?",
    "Could be. Could be not. Who knows?",
    "Why do you care?",
    "Does it really matter?",
    "Letâ€™s just pretend I answered that for you.",
    "Iâ€™ll let you figure that one out.",
    "I donâ€™t know, and I donâ€™t care.",
    "Thatâ€™s your problem, not mine.",
    "I donâ€™t think I have an answer to that.",
    "I was going to answer, but then I got distracted.",
    "Is this even a question?",
    "You probably already know the answer.",
    "Iâ€™m just here to give vague answers.",
    "Thatâ€™s what I would say if I knew the answer.",
    "Iâ€™m busy. Can we talk later?",
    "Who cares?",
    "Let me think... nope, no idea.",
    "I have no clue, but thanks for asking anyway.",
    "Iâ€™m trying to avoid this conversation.",
    "Not today, thanks.",
    "Iâ€™ve already answered that... like 10 times.",
    "This is definitely not the answer you wanted.",
    "I donâ€™t even know what that means.",
    "Maybe if you asked me in a more interesting way...",
    "Canâ€™t help you with that one.",
    "I could tell you, but then Iâ€™d have to... nah, just kidding.",
    "Do I look like I know?",
    "Thatâ€™s a great question... for someone else.",
    "I think you already know the answer.",
    "Thatâ€™s above my pay grade.",
    "Iâ€™m not even going to bother.",
    "This seems like a trick question.",
    "What do you mean by that?",
    "Iâ€™m not sure what youâ€™re asking, but I donâ€™t care.",
    "Do I look like I care?",
    "Why are you asking me this?",
    "Youâ€™re asking the wrong person.",
    "You probably donâ€™t want to hear the answer.",
    "Iâ€™m out of ideas.",
    "What a question! I have no answer.",
    "Iâ€™m not sure what youâ€™re looking for, but good luck.",
    "You tell me.",
    "Donâ€™t ask me. I donâ€™t know.",
    "Iâ€™m going to have to pass on this one.",
    "I feel like you already know the answer.",
    "Iâ€™m too busy thinking about important things.",
    "Can you ask something else?",
    "Youâ€™re on your own with that one.",
    "I think you already know what you want to hear.",
    "Iâ€™m just here for the vibes.",
    "Thatâ€™s your job, not mine.",
    "Ugh, fine, whatever you say.",
    "That doesnâ€™t sound right, but okay.",
    "I think youâ€™re overthinking it.",
    "If I tell you, will you leave me alone?",
    "Youâ€™ve got Google for a reason.",
    "Okay, sure, I guess.",
    "I donâ€™t have an answer for that... and Iâ€™m okay with that.",
    "Well, that's inconvenient.",
    "That's... a little too much for me.",
    "I don't have time for this.",
    "I don't know, and frankly, I don't care.",
    "Thatâ€™s your problem now.",
    "Did you think I would know that?",
    "That's above my pay grade.",
    "Donâ€™t ask me. Iâ€™m just here to confuse you.",
    "Itâ€™s complicated... but I donâ€™t want to explain it.",
    "Iâ€™d help, but Iâ€™m too lazy.",
    "Iâ€™d tell you, but I don't feel like it.",
    "I don't have the energy for that today.",
    "Thatâ€™s what you get for asking me.",
    "Thatâ€™s a tough one... nope, still no answer.",
    "You think I know the answer to that?",
    "Sounds like a you problem.",
    "I was going to answer, but I forgot what I was going to say.",
    "You must be joking.",
    "I donâ€™t know. Itâ€™s not my area of expertise.",
    "I could help, but... nah.",
    "That's a question that Iâ€™ll leave unanswered.",
    "Donâ€™t look at me for help!",
    "Is that even a question?",
    "Iâ€™m going to pretend I didnâ€™t hear that.",
    "Ask me again later.",
    "I'm just here to ignore you.",
    "I donâ€™t want to answer that.",
    "Iâ€™ve run out of answers.",
    "Thatâ€™s a question I donâ€™t even want to think about.",
    "I think you can figure that out without me.",
    "Well, I guess youâ€™ll have to wait for the answer.",
    "I donâ€™t know and I don't care to know.",
    "Iâ€™m too cool for this question.",
    "No one knows the answer to that.",
    "I canâ€™t be bothered right now.",
    "Iâ€™m literally not sure what you mean.",
    "Thatâ€™s a question for someone else.",
    "Itâ€™s not even worth answering.",
    "Thatâ€™s above my understanding.",
    "I donâ€™t even want to try answering that.",
    "I'm done with this question."
